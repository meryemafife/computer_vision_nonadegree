# Landmark Detection

In this project, I implement SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2-dimensional world.  Sensor and motion data gathered by a simulated robot is used to create a map of an environment. SLAM gives us a way to track the location of a robot in the world in real-time and identify the locations of landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, etc.
